Dreaming is a Projection Mapping performance created for the Sala di Diana at the Reggia di Venaria, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The project was developed in dialogue with the performance of a live string quartet alternated with electronic ambient elements performed by NOVA. The project transformed the historic space through video mapping techniques, using light and motion to reinterpret the architectural and sculptural richness of the venue.
The visual design was conceived to seamlessly integrate with the existing stuccoes, reliefs, and statues, enhancing their volumes rather than obscuring them. Abstract, fluid, and symmetrical compositions were mapped onto the complex surfaces of the architecture, allowing the visuals to follow and amplify the rhythm and geometry of the space.
