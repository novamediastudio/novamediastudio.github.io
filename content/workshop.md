Along with their artistic practice, Nova Media Studio dedicates time to sharing their understanding of new media arts. In collaboration with <a href="https://www.recontemporary.com" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">Recontemporary</a>, they organized a Projection Mapping workshop, now in its second edition.

Curated by Federica Sorba and Eduard Tampu, the workshop provides participants with an overview of video-mapping and visual design, combining theory and practice to develop technical and creative skills. It offers an opportunity to delve into the methodologies and tools needed to create impactful visual installations.

The program begins with an introduction to video-mapping techniques, hardware, and software, exploring various application contexts from installations to AV performances. Participants engage in the *Unreal Windows* activity, projecting on flat surfaces using TouchDesigner.

The second day shifts focus to content creation, introducing generative visuals and particle systems within TouchDesigner. Participants explore 3D mapping techniques through the *Magic Policubes* activity, applying their visuals to complex surfaces.

The final day expands into 3D scanning and advanced visual effects. The *Living Things* activity challenges participants to project onto complex objects, integrating the generative content developed throughout the workshop. The experience concludes with a presentation of case studies and past projects.
